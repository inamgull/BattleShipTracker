# BattleShipTracker
Battle Ship tracker Library in c#


The Player class implements Battleship state-tracker for a single player and supports the following methods:

Create a board // through player initialization
Add a battleship to the board
Take an “attack” at a given position, and report back whether the attack resulted in a hit or a miss
Return whether the player has lost the game yet (i.e. all battleships are sunk)

Becuase of shortage of time unit tests only covers partial cases.
